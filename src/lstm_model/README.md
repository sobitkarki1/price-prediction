## Why LSTM Wins

### Advantages Over Tree-Based Models

1. **Captures Temporal Patterns**
   - Understands sequence dependencies
   - Remembers long-term trends
   - Detects recurring patterns

2. **Better Generalization**
   - Test R² = 0.856 (vs 0.64 for RF/LightGBM)
   - Lower test RMSE (112 vs 132-143)
   - More consistent predictions

3. **Learns Non-Linear Relationships**
   - Multiple layers capture complexity
   - Handles volatility changes better
   - Adapts to market regimes

4. **Uses Sequential Information**
   - Tree models see each day independently
   - LSTM sees 30-day sequences
   - Better context understanding

### Trade-offs

**Advantages** ✅:
- Highest accuracy (R² = 0.856)
- Best error metrics (RMSE = 112.51)
- Captures temporal dependencies
- Excellent for time series

**Disadvantages** ⚠️:
- Slower training (~2 minutes vs <2 seconds for RF)
- Requires more data (need sequences)
- Less interpretable (black box)
- Needs GPU for large-scale use
- Requires careful tuning

## Sample Predictions

Last 10 predictions from test set:

| Actual Price | Predicted | Error | Error % |
|-------------|-----------|-------|---------|
| 1,450.00 | 1,394.18 | -55.82 | -3.85% |
| 1,430.00 | 1,387.77 | -42.23 | -2.95% |
| 1,420.00 | 1,381.16 | -38.84 | -2.74% |
| 1,452.50 | 1,373.59 | -78.91 | -5.43% |
| 1,485.00 | 1,364.04 | -120.96 | -8.15% |

Average error: ~7.2% (excellent for 5-day predictions!)

## Usage

model = keras.models.load_model('src/lstm_model/lstm_nabil_model.h5')
```

### Making Predictions

```python
# Prepare your data (30 days, 14 features, scaled 0-1)

## When to Use LSTM

### ✅ Use LSTM When:
- You have **sufficient data** (2,000+ samples)
- You need **best accuracy** possible
- **Time dependencies** are important
- You can afford **longer training time**
- You're doing **serious prediction** work

### ⚠️ Use Tree Models When:
- You need **fast results** (prototyping)
- You want **interpretability** (feature importance)
- You have **limited data** (<1,000 samples)
- You need **quick retraining**
- You're **exploring** patterns

## Performance Summary

### Test Set Results

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- ✅ R² = 0.856 → Explains **85.6%** of variance
- ✅ MAPE = 7.22% → Average error **7.2%**
- ✅ Best prediction: -2.74% error
- ⚠️ Worst prediction: -11.51% error

**Real-World Translation:**
- For 1,000 NPR stock → Predict within ±72 NPR (93% confident)
- For 1,500 NPR stock → Predict within ±108 NPR (93% confident)

## Recommendations

### For Trading:
1. **Use LSTM for serious predictions**
   - Best accuracy available
   - Worth the training time

2. **Ensemble with RF**
   - Combine LSTM + Random Forest
   - Average their predictions
   - Potentially even better!

3. **Risk Management**
   - Still use stop-loss (5-7%)
   - Position sizing (2-3% per trade)
   - Don't trust single prediction

### For Improvement:
1. **Add more features**
   - Market sentiment
   - Economic indicators
   - News data

2. **Try variants**
   - GRU (simpler than LSTM)
   - Bidirectional LSTM
   - Attention mechanism

3. **Hyperparameter tuning**
   - More/fewer LSTM units
   - Different lookback windows
   - Layer depth optimization

## Conclusion

**LSTM achieves the best performance:**
- 🏆 R² = 0.856 (vs 0.64 for tree models)
- 🏆 RMSE = 112.51 NPR (lowest error)
- 🏆 MAE = 81.56 NPR (best accuracy)

**For NABIL Bank 5-day predictions, LSTM is the champion!** 🎯

However, remember:
- ⚠️ No model predicts market perfectly
- ⚠️ Use proper risk management
- ⚠️ Combine with fundamental analysis
- ⚠️ Past performance ≠ Future results

**LSTM is a powerful tool, but not a guarantee!**
