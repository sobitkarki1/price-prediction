## NABIL Bank: Detailed Analysis

### üèÜ Winner: LSTM Neural Network

**Performance:**
- R¬≤ Score: **0.8560** (30% better than tree models!)
- RMSE: **112.51 NPR** (lowest error)

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è Training time: ~2 minutes (vs <2 seconds for RF)
- üß† Requires more data (needs sequences)
- üîç Less interpretable (black box)
- üíª Benefits from GPU (optional)

---

### ü•à Runner-Up: LightGBM Basic

## SCB Bank: The Problem Child

### All Models Failed on SCB

| Model | R¬≤ Score | RMSE | MAPE | Status |
|-------|----------|------|------|--------|
| **LSTM** | **-18.24** üíÄ | 256.24 | 42.64% | CATASTROPHIC |
| Random Forest | -2.86 | 233.50 | 18.53% | FAILED |
| LightGBM | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not tested |

### Why SCB is Unpredictable

1. **Extreme Volatility**
   - Price swings are larger and more random
   - Multiple regime changes
   - Structural breaks in data

2. **Negative R¬≤ Means:**
   - Model worse than just predicting average
   - Captures noise, not signal
   - Fundamentally unpredictable with current features

3. **What's Needed:**
   - Regime detection (bull/bear/sideways)
   - Shorter prediction horizon (1-day instead of 5)
   - External features (news, economics, sector data)
   - Different preprocessing approach

---

## Key Learnings from All Experiments

### ‚úÖ What Works

1. **LSTM for Best Accuracy**
   - 85.6% variance explained
   - Worth the training time for serious predictions

2. **Simple > Complex**
   - LightGBM 15 features beats 83 features
   - 200 trees beats 2000 trees
   - Overfitting is real!

3. **NABIL > SCB**
   - Some stocks are just more predictable
   - Liquidity, stability matter

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Good features > complex algorithms
   - Volume indicators are key
   - Time-based features help

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

1. **10x Parameters**
   - 2000 trees: worse accuracy, 12x slower
   - More ‚â† Better

2. **Too Many Features**
   - 83 features caused overfitting
   - Less is more with limited data

3. **One-Size-Fits-All**
   - NABIL model doesn't work for SCB
   - Each stock needs custom approach

4. **Ignoring Validation**
   - SCB showed failures in cross-validation
   - Don't ignore warning signs!

## Recommendations by Use Case

### For Production Trading (NABIL Only)

**Best Choice: LSTM**
```
‚úÖ Highest accuracy (R¬≤ = 0.856)
‚úÖ Lowest errors (RMSE = 112.51)
‚úÖ Best for serious trading
‚ö†Ô∏è Requires 2-minute retraining
```

**Alternative: Random Forest**
```
‚úÖ Fast training (<2 seconds)
‚úÖ Good accuracy (R¬≤ = 0.640)
‚úÖ Interpretable
‚úÖ Good for real-time updates
```

**Budget Option: LightGBM Basic**
```
‚úÖ Simplest model
‚úÖ Fastest training
‚úÖ Decent accuracy (R¬≤ = 0.658)
‚úÖ Easy to understand
```

### For SCB Trading

**‚õî DO NOT TRADE SCB WITH CURRENT MODELS**

All models failed catastrophically. Need:
1. Regime detection
2. External data sources
3. Different approach (maybe ARIMA, Prophet)
4. Or just avoid SCB entirely

### For Research/Learning

**Use All Three:**
1. Start with LightGBM (fast, interpretable)
2. Try Random Forest (robust, clear)
3. Graduate to LSTM (best accuracy)
